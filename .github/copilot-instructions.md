# Copilot Instructions
- This is a Visual Studio extension project
- It uses the latest version of C# that is supported on .NET Framework 4.8
- source.extension.cs and VSCommandTable.cs are generated files, but you can't generate them, so just edit them directly
 
# Team Best Practices
- A lot of developers with no experience in Visual Studio extensions will be reading the code.
- The code must be readable and maintainable, especially for new team members.
- Simplicity is key.
- Don't use emojis in .md files and elsewhere.
- Don't use the em-dash character (—), use single hyphens (-) surrounded by space characters instead.
